# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
-----------

This is a movie recommendation system that uses machine learning and natural language processing techniques to suggest similar movies based on various factors such as:

* **Movie similarity**: recommends movies that are similar to the one selected by the user
* **Genre-based recommendation**: recommends movies of the same genre as the one selected by the user
* **Actor-based recommendation**: recommends movies featuring the same actor as the one selected by the user
* **Director-based recommendation**: recommends movies directed by the same director as the one selected by the user
